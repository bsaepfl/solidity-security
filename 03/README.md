# Exercise 3

Could you exploit this contract to empty its funds? 

**Network** : `rinkeby`

**Contract address** : `0x00dab768d4446702D2bDd230D80C5B90e8f07CbD`

Hints : 

1. The attack is common known vulnerability. Don't look too far [here](https://blog.sigmaprime.io/solidity-security.html) for inspiration. Your attack should use another smart-contract to exploit the current contract.

2. Pay attention to the code of the deployed contract BalelecTrustFund.sol. What you see is not always what you get. 

3. Be curious of past transactions, both deploy and internal. 

4. No private key with test-ether will be provided, please use the rinkeby [faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/) for test transactions, contract deployments etc..

5. Once you understand what the contract does and how it works, send a quick report on slack @solerus
